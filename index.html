                        <p1>Schedule tracker: With our sleek scrollable user interface, you can easily find out what and when your next class is. You can personalize your classes by clicking the "Customize" button located on the header of the Schedule Screen. </p1>
                        <p></p>
                        <p1>Automatic class group chat: Our app automatically creates a group chat for students enrolled in the same class. To ensure privacy among students, this screen is only available for students with brooklinek12.org domain emails. Our team reserves the right to not hand over text messages to teachers and administrators.</p1>
                        <p></p>
                        <p1>Announcements: We offer students the opportunity to post schoolwide announcements. Note that after you post, your announcement <b>cannot be deleted</b>. If you wish to delete your post, please contact bhsappdevclub@gmail.com. Also, understand that your post will be associated with your full name and the date/time you posted on, so please be sure that your post is relevant and appropriate for the BHS community.</p1>
                        <p></p>
                        <p1>Friend finder: Our app enables you to make new friends! By clicking "Make a Friend" you are automatically paired up with the next BHS student who also requests a friend. Please note that your full name, phone number, and school email will be shared with your matched friend, so don't request a friend if you don't feel comfortable sending this information out. Because being paired with a teacher as a friend can be a bit awkward, this screen is only available for students with brooklinek12.org domain emails.</p1>
                        <p></p>
                        <p1>If you are interested in viewing the app's source code, please go <a href="https://github.com/bhsappdev/bhs" target="_blank">here.</a> We encourage you to make contributions to the app!</p1>
